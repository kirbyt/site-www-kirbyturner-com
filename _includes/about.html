                <p>Hi, my name is Kirby Turner. I'm an independent software developer and <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">business owner</a>. I've been programming since the early 1980s. I sell my own apps, and I write apps for others. My speciality is writing end-to-end apps for Mac and iOS using Objective-C and Swift with Node.js on the backend.

                <p>When I'm not sitting behind the keyboard, I can be found hanging out with my wife Melanie and my son Rowan, hiking the mountains of New England, kayaking the waters in and around Vermont, and snowboarding down mountains in search of powder.</p>
