Released [Hey Peanut][1], White Peak Software's fourth application and the second iOS app. I became much more active in the Cocoa developer community, attending and speaking at conferences, meet ups and CocoaHeads, and started my own group called [NSHappyHour][2]. I also started writing a [book][3] on learning iPad programming.
