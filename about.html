## About

Hi, my name is Kirby Turner. I'm a software engineer at Apple. Before joining Apple, I ran my own software company for 14 years. I got my start at programming in the early 1980s, and I can't image doing anything else as a career.

When I'm not sitting behind the keyboard, I can be found hanging out with my wife Melanie and my son Rowan, hiking the mountains of New England, kayaking the waters in and around Vermont, and snowboarding down mountains in search of epic powder.
