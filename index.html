    <div><p>My name is Kirby Turner. I'm an independent software developer and <a href="http://whitepeaksoftware.com/">business owner</a> focusing on Mac and iOS programming. I've been programming since the early 1980s. I sell my own apps. I do contract programming when time allows. And I wrote a <a href="learning-ipad-programminga-.html">book on iPad programming</a>.</p>
    <p>In 2007, I made my move from the Microsoft world to the world built by a particularly wonderful <a href="http://www.apple.com/">fruit company</a> out of Cupertino, California. It didn't take long before I fell in love with Cocoa and Xcode. The developer experience created by Apple makes programming fun for me again, something I hadn't felt since the early days of Delphi.</p>
    <p>When I'm not sitting behind the keyboard, I can be found hanging out with my wife Melanie and my son Rowan, hiking the mountains of New England, kayaking the waters in and around Salem, Massachusetts, and snowboarding down mountains in search of powder.</p>
